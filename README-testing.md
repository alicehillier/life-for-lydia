## **User Stories**

### **First-Time Visitor Goal**

1. I want to learn how to to play the game/interact with the story.
  - Instructions are provided in the introduction section of the app.   

2. I want to be able to quit.
  - The instructions state that the user can return to the main menu by entering '0' at any decision point. 

3. I want to make decisions.
  - Decisions are integral to the interactive story and the user is required to make decisions in order to move forward in the story.

4. I want the text to presented to me clearly.
  - Dictionaries and current time/date are formatted so that information is displayed in standard text. This ensures that the flow of the story is not interrupted and the user is not confused by the presentation.

### **Returning Visitor Goal**

1. I want to select the next chapter.
  - The user is able to select which chapter they would like to read, so they are not forced to start from the beginning every time they visit the app. If the user is reading chapter one, they have the option to read chapter two once they reach the end of the chapter. The user can also return to the main menu at any decision point and select a different chapter.

2. I want to replay the story and make different choices.
  - A variety of choices are available to the user throughout both chapters. Making different decisions may alter the outcome of the story or provide the user with more information. Therefore, replaying the story can give the user a fuller experience.

3. I want to see the consequences of my decisions.
  - The outcome of the story may be altered by the decisions the user makes. For example, in chapter two, the character faces different charges depending on the decisions made by the user. 

### **Frequent Visitor Goal**

1. I want to experience all of the possible outcomes.
  - As there are several decision points in each chapter, the user can explore different options when they replay the story. While alternate outcomes are currently limited, future chapters could be greatly influenced by the decisions made by the user early in the story.

2. I want to find out new information by making a different choice.
  - Making certain decisions in the story may reveal new information to the user or affect the story. For example, in chapter one, the user will only know there is blood on the stair bannister if they choose not to open the door. While this may not necessarily affect the outcome of the story, it gives it more depth and allows the user a greater insight into what has happened.
