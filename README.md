Welcome,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project. The last update to this file was: **March 14, 2023**

## Reminders

- Your code must be placed in the `run.py` file
- Your dependencies must be placed in the `requirements.txt` file
- Do not edit any of the other files or your code may not deploy properly

## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.

## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.

---

Happy coding!

## **Introduction**

Welcome to *Life for Lydia*, an interactive, terminal-based story powered by Python. Consisting of two chapters, the 
interactive story is designed for readers and gamers alike. Choose your own path and make important decisions
to discover more.

*Life for Lydia* is an interactive story made with Python, created by Alice Hillier for the third project in Code Instituteâ€™s Diploma in Software Development programme.

## **UX Design**

### **Strategy Plane**

In order to gauge what makes a successful interactive story, I drew on my own experience of reading books like
*Goosebumps* and playing games like the more recent editions of *Assassin's Creed* and *Telltale's The Walking Dead*.  

#### **[Goosebumps]**

![] 

-	Offered meaningful choices to the reader.
- Players turned to the page indicated based on their choice.

#### **[Assassin's Creed]**

![]

- Offered meaningful choices to the player.
- The main story remained the same, with alterations according to the players' choices.
- Making certain choices affected the character's relationships, revealed new information and impacted the lives of other characters.

#### **[The Walking Dead]**

- Offered meaningful choices to the player.
- The main story remained the same, with alterations according to the players' choices.
- Making certain choices affected the character's relationships and future opportunities.

### **Skeleton Plane**

When starting to design my story, I created detailed text documents using Google Docs, and flow diagrams using Figma.
